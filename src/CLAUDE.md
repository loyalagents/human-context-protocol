# Conventions 
Make sure to always update:
- README.md
- architecture.md
- any tsconfig.json
- any appropriate swagger documentation. this includes calls and schemas. Each non mcp-service should only be accessible via the gateway

In addition the README.md contains information about making new services and updating files. Please make sure that information is correct and update it if that information is incorrect.
